## MVP
Upon load, user will be prompted to enter their unique username. This allows the user to later return to their saved pokemon collection.

The App allows users to generate a non-detailed list of pokemon, based on a user-searched _type_ (ie. grass). The pokemon listed will show an image of their sprite-form, name, pokedex number, and a save option.

Upon clicking the save button, the currently chosen pokemon will be saved to the database, in the user's "Favorites" page (link available in nav). 

The favorites page will display the selected pokemon which the user has favorited, in no specific order. Each listing will display the pokemon's name, image sprite, and other detailed information including stats.
